# GCP-Covid-DataMining

Here we explore data extraction from 3 sources - a Snowflake database, GCP BigQuery and OWID website.
We then create a Python notebook within GCP Vertex AI and use the data collected in this notebook. We create a Pandas DataFrame to work with the collected data.
We clone the GitHub repository in Google Cloud and work in a notebook instance within it.
